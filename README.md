# Pizza Sales--DataAnalysis using SQL & PowerBI

This project involves visualizing and analyzing pizza sales based on various features such as quantity, name, size, and category. We will also examine customer preferences for different types of pizzas, identify the top-selling pizzas within each category, and delve into metrics like revenue, quantity, and size.

📈 Results and Impact:
I have successfully obtained insights regarding total revenue, total orders, average order value, average pizza order, and further diversified data based on the most popular month, the days of the week with the maximum orders, the most favorite categories, and preferred sizes.

🎓 Key Takeaways:
This was an interesting project. I first analyzed all the data in SQL and also created a PDF report from it. Then, I visualized the data and created two dashboards in Power BI.

In the first dashboard, you can observe the general trends in daily and monthly sales, the percentage of sales by pizza category and size, as well as important KPIs and insights on the left side.

In the second dashboard, I analyzed the best and worst selling pizzas based on revenue, quantity, and total orders. The insights related to these are provided on the left side.
